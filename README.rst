In group theory, Young frames offer a graphical representation to work with
conjugacy classes and irreducible representations. This program multiplies
:math:`\mathrm{SU}(n)` Young frames and decomposes the result into conjugacy
classes. I have written this for the `Group Theory lecture`__ inspired by a
homework exercise.
